      "description": "Find answers to common questions about Subtitle Translator",
      "q1": {
        "question": "Is Subtitle Translator completely free?",
        "answer": "Yes! The tool itself is completely free. You can use the free Google Translate (GTX) API without any cost. For premium translation services like DeepL or OpenAI, you'll need your own API key, but those services often have free tiers available."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How do I get an API key for DeepL or OpenAI?",
        "answer": "Visit the respective service's website (linked in the Translation APIs section), create an account, and generate an API key. DeepL offers a free tier with 500,000 characters per month, and OpenAI offers $5 in free credits for new accounts."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Can I translate multiple subtitle files at once?",
        "answer": "Yes! Simply upload multiple files in the input area. The tool will process them sequentially and download each translated file automatically. You can also enable multi-language mode to translate one file into multiple target languages at once."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Will my subtitle timings be preserved?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! The tool preserves all timestamps, formatting, and structure. Only the text content is translated while everything else remains exactly as it was in the original file."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What is context-aware translation and when should I use it?",
        "answer": "Context-aware translation uses AI to understand the dialogue flow and context of your subtitles. This results in more natural translations that maintain character voice and handle idioms better. It's recommended when using LLM services (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.) and when translation quality is more important than speed."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Is my data private and secure?",
        "answer": "Yes! All processing happens in your browser. Your API keys are stored locally using browser localStorage and are never sent to our servers. The subtitle content is only sent to the translation API you select (Google, DeepL, OpenAI, etc.) according to their respective privacy policies."
